      It wasn't until recently that I became interested in Web Developement. Spending the last 6+ years of my life as a "Digital Nomad", I spent my days building e-Commerce businesses from the ground up and selling them after a few succesful years. The Philippines was my home, and I was happy. But I grew tired of the "same old, same old", and longed for a new challenge. "How are these websites I'm running even built?" I wondered. I did a bit of Googling (a must-have skill in the world of Web Developement, so I'm told), and learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not having a clue about what any of these languages were, I was intrigued. I signed up for Codecademy and Free Code Camp, among others (and also spent dozens of hours reading Stack Overflow Q&A's). In a moment's notice, I had become completely thrown into the deep, dark rabbit hole of Web Developement - and I knew that there was no going back.
